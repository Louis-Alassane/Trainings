## Final Notes

Please take the time to go through the surveyCTO documentation related to your part of the survey process ! We need to make sure that we don't miss out on useful features!

**--> Link is on github**

More functionalities are coming (own dashboards etc ...). Please tell me if you have requests!

I will organise a workshop when they are ready!
