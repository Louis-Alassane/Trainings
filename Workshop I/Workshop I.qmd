## Deal with enumerators

::: panel-tabset
# Theory

::: fragment
**int** - YYMMXX

> Year they were recruited , Month they were recruited, Unique Number (01,02,03,04), should be in order they join
:::

::: fragment
1.  Create/Update Enumerator's List (don't forget projects )
:::

::: fragment
2.  Update Admin list (for contracts)
:::

::: fragment
3.  Generate QR codes
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
4.  Give their ID/QR codes to enumerators
:::

::: fragment
During/After the field:

-   Update list with blacklisted people (add B to their ID's)
:::

# Practice

1.  Create a "fake enumerators" list
2.  For the sake of Workshop fill the list as if people joined on different months/year
3.  Update the "Admin" list
4.  Generate QR codes (tip: use an extension)
:::

## Create a Survey

::: panel-tabset
## Theory

Use a common language

Commonalities:

1.  Questionnaires/IDs
2.  Question Types
3.  Recurrent Variables
4.  Recurrent Values

## Practice

-   Translate "NDI_Modified" using our new language
:::

## Final Request
